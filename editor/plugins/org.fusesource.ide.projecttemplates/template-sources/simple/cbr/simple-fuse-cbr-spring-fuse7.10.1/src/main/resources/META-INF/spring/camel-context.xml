          When this route is started, it will automatically create the work/cbr/input directory where you can drop the
          file that need to be processed.

          The <log/> elements are used to add human-friendly business logging statements. They make it easier to see what the
          route is doing.

          The <choice/> element contains the content based router. The two <when/> clauses use XPath to define the criteria 
          for entering that part of the route. When the country in the XML message is set to UK or US, the file will be 
          moved to a directory for that country. The <otherwise/> element ensures that any file that does not meet the 
          requirements for either of the <when/> elements will be moved to the work/cbr/output/others directory.
