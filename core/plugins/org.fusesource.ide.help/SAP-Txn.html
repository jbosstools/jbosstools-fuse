                with SAP. A destination endpoint with a URL containing the transacted option set to
                    <code class="code">true</code> will, if necessary, initiate a stateful session on the
                outbound connection of the endpoint and register a Camel Synchronization object with
                the exchange. This synchronization object will call the BAPI service method
                    <code class="code">BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT</code> and end the stateful session when the
                processing of the message exchange is complete. If the processing of the message
                exchange fails, the synchronization object will call the BAPI server method
                    <code class="code">BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK</code> and end the stateful session.</p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e153010"></a>RFC transaction model</h3></div></div></div><p>The tRFC protocol accomplishes an AT-MOST-ONCE delivery and processing guarantee
                by identifying each transactional request with a unique transaction identifier
                (TID). A TID accompanies each request sent in the protocol. A sending application
                using the tRFC protocol must identify each instance of a request with a unique TID
                when sending the request. An application may send a request with a given TID
                multiple times, but the protocol ensures that the request is delivered and processed
                in the receiving system at most once. An application may choose to resend a request
                with a given TID when encountering a communication or system error when sending the
                request, and is thus in doubt as to whether that request was delivered and processed
                in the receiving system. By resending a request when encountering an communication
                error, a client application using the tRFC protocol can thus ensure EXACTLY-ONCE
                delivery and processing guarantees for its request.</p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e153015"></a>Which transaction model to use?</h3></div></div></div><p>A BAPI transaction is an application level transaction, in the sense that it
                imposes ACID guarantees on the persistent data changes performed by a BAPI method or
                RFC function in the SAP database. An RFC transaction is a communication transaction,
                in the sense that it imposes delivery guarantees (AT-MOST-ONCE, EXACTLY-ONCE,
                EXACTLY-ONCE-IN-ORDER) on requests to a BAPI method and/or RFC function.</p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="SAP-Txn-RFCDestination"></a>Transactional RFC destination endpoints</h3></div></div></div><p>The following destination endpoints support RFC transactions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">sap-trfc-destination</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">sap-qrfc-destination</code></p></li></ul></div><p>A single Camel route can include multiple transactional RFC destination endpoints,
                sending messages to multiple RFC destinations and even sending messages to the same
                RFC destination multiple times. This implies that the Camel SAP component
                potentially needs to keep track of <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> transaction IDs (TIDs)
                for each <code class="code">Exchange</code> object passing along a route. Now if the route
                processing fails and must be retried, the situation gets quite complicated. The RFC
                transaction semantics demand that each RFC destination along the route must be
                invoked using the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> TID that was used the first time around
                (and where the TIDs for each of the destinations are distinct from each other). In
                other words, the Camel SAP component must keep track of which TID was used at which
                point along the route, and remember this information, so that the TIDs can be
                replayed in the correct order.</p><p>By default, Camel does not provide a mechanism that enables an
                    <code class="code">Exchange</code> to know where it is in a route. To provide such a
                mechanism, it is necessary to install the
                    <code class="code">CurrentProcessorDefinitionInterceptStrategy</code> interceptor into the
                Camel runtime. This interceptor must be installed into the Camel runtime, in order
                for the Camel SAP component to keep track of the TIDs in a route. For details of how
                to configure the interceptor, see <a class="xref" href="SAP-DestConfig.html#SAP-DestConfig-Intercept" title="Interceptor for tRFC and qRFC destinations">Interceptor for tRFC and qRFC destinations</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e153055"></a>Transactional RFC server endpoints</h3></div></div></div><p>The following server endpoints support RFC transactions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">sap-trfc-server</code></p></li></ul></div><p>When a Camel exchange processing a transactional request encounters a processing
                error, Camel handles the processing error through its standard error handling
                mechanisms. If the Camel route processing the exchange is configured to propagate
                the error back to the caller, the SAP server endpoint that initiated the exchange
                takes note of the failure and the sending SAP system is notified of the error. The
                sending SAP system can then respond by sending another transaction request with the
                same TID to process the request again.</p></div></div></body></html>
