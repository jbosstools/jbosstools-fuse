<h1>
    Analyzing object references
</h1>
<p>
    When you find out which objects are actually consuming heap memory, 
    you may want to see which objects are keeping the reference to those objects.
    JVM Monitor doesn't provide an ability to analyze the references, 
    but instead provide an ability to generate <b>hprof file</b>, so that you can further analyze 
    the references with other tools like <b>Memory Analyzer</b>.
</p>
<p>
    To analyze object references:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Press <b>Dump heap as hprof file</b> button
    [<img src="./img/take_hprof_dump.gif" style="vertical-align: middle"/>] at the local toolbar to generate hprof file.
    </li>
    <li>
    Analyze object references with hprof file. 
    In case Memory Analyzer plug-ins are installed in your Eclipse, 
    Memory Analyzer is automatically opened after generating hprof file.
    </li>
</ol>
