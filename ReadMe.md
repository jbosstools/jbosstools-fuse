# Red Hat Fuse Tooling for Eclipse

---
**NOTE**

Red Hat Fuse Tooling for Eclipse Desktop is deprecated since 11.19.0 version.

For Camel 3+ projects, recommendations are to use the [VS Code extension pack for Camel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.apache-camel-extension-pack) or to stay on Eclipse Desktop using [Textual Language Support](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/language-support-apache-camel) and [Debug Adapter for Camel](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel).
The extension pack also includes a graphical editor.
